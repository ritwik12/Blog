Hey,
I'm Ritwik Sharma, a third year Computer Science Engineering student pursuing my bachelors from UPES dehradun.
I am currently living at Dehradun, India.

I started actual coding on coming to college. (Well if you consider coding as writing loops and not knowing about arrays,
then Iâ€™m afraid my claim is wrong). I did have to spend a huge amount of time programming to get to this level.

I always had great interest in Web development so I learned it on my own.
Internet helped me a lot in learning HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, Bootstrap, etc.

I like to work on Open source and I am always eager for new ideas and opportunities to work on,
I like to code and I try my best to improve my coding skills whenever I can.
As in a world full of great programmers I am a small fraction.

In my first year of college I was a CSI (Computer Society Of India) core committee member and
I enjoyed working as an event organizer and successfully organized two technical events at CSI
national fest YUGMUK.
In my third year I moved more towards Artificial Intelligence and started learning it,
at the end of my fifth semester I ended up developing my first project in A.I
and ranked 1st in the whole university for Minor projects.
