title: UP-FOR-GRABS!
---

It's been a long time working with up-for-grabs, It all started with my impatience in getting a PR merged :p and the busy schedule of [Brendan Forster](https://github.com/shiftkey) and [Keith Dahlby](https://github.com/dahlbyk). Once my PR was getting delayed and I needed some contributions from people, I pointed out that collaborators are busy enough and we should add someone to handle it in their absence. I wasn't thinking that they will add me, then Keith asked me if I am volunteering to be a part of it. Obviously, I said yes ;). It's been a great time working with them as I get to see a lot many new projects and awesome people. Yeah, it is hard to manage as I have been busy too from a long time, but I always try to get as much time as I can contribute and merge new PRs as quickly as possible because I don't want people waiting. Also, I love it here as Brendan is an awesome guy. He treats people equally and never makes me feel that my opinion is less important than his.
