I am just a normal guy sharing my thoughts, I am no one at all in this wide world of Intelligent minds.</p>


<h2>Dream big, why the hell not</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
People don't dream big because they think they are not good or not worth dreaming it for. I guess nobody is until they dream it.
Without thinking about doing something how can a person achieve that? That's easily said than done. I know that :p.
Still, there's no loss in dreaming for things that you love or want. Nobody is born with talent or skills. Also, always keep your dreams to yourself or to your limited circle of loved ones only. People have a habit of ruining beautiful things before they
even happen.</p>

<h2>If you don't have a Dream, go explore and have a dream of your own first. If you do, Continue reading!!</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The big thing is done, you already know what you want. Now it's about making your way up and achieving it.
To get things done first be aware of what it takes. No dream should cost you your Happiness. If a dream is taking your Happiness from you, It isn't worth going too far for it. Stay Happy and Smile :) first. So, I suppose you are smiling and thinking about your dream. Every person is very unique. We all have very different dreams. and to achieve them it will also take different approaches
and that too will be of your own. Making your own way to somewhere requires a lot of will and belief in yourself. Have faith that you can do, if you can't then do what it takes to make yourself believe that you can. Things get better when you have trust
and faith in yourself. Nobody can push you if you aren't pushing yourself.</p>

<h2>It's ohk to have fun because if you don't, Frustration and Depression is on your way</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
When you aim for something there's a chance you will be successful or fail. Every failure is just a milestone to your utmost goal.
If you think you have lost, you already lost the fight. If you think you can still get up, you have just fallen and you will stand again.
The beauty of failure is that it is the ugliest and worst thing ever that will happen to you. and believe me, every failure
hurts. It's just that we get used to with getting hurt. It's a big loop of thoughts when you fail and it eventually leads to
Depression. you will start thinking that nothing good ever happens to me. It will continue until you get your first success.
Do something every day that makes you happy and keeps your mind away from bad thoughts. It could be anything from sleeping to 
playing sports, listening to music or reading books.</p>

<h2>Enough now, I'm not the one</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
At times you will give up, or should I say every time something bad happens you will surely want to just give up. That's human nature.
If you gave up, don't be disheartened we all do at some point. just find a reason to get back and starten up. There's a long way
 to go.</p>

<h2>You are the one!!</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
It's a dream that you decided on your own. Nobody pushed it to you, then why aren't you the one. You can do it and only you will do it. It's not a good coffee until it's crushed from beans that were ones living quite well on a plant. I do love a good cup of coffee, but I never thought about those coffee beans. You also should not, just think about how good it tastes and leave the tough part aside. At last, it will feel good. If it doesn't, there's still a lot to go</p>

<h2>Never ever give up!, Your dreams are waiting!!</h2>
