Following your heart and doing something other than the usual</p>

<h3>Innovation</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Some paraphrased selections from <a href="https://www.ideatovalue.com/inno/nickskillicorn/2016/03/innovation-15-experts-share-innovation-definition/">
an article by Nick Skillicorn</a> based on interviews with 15 innovators:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Application of ideas that are novel and useful</li>
  <li>It’s about staying relevant</li>
  <li>Great idea, executed brilliantly, and communicated well</li>
  <li>Feasible, relevant offering with a viable business model perceived as new and adopted by customers</li>
  <li>Introduction of new products and services that add value to an organization</li>
  <li>As long as it includes “new” and addresses customer needs, any variation goes</li>
  <li>Fundamental way companies bring constant value to their customers</li>
  <li>Work that delivers new goodness to customers in new markets and radically improves the profitability equation</li>
  <li>Implementation of something new</li>
  <li>Implementation of creative ideas to generate value</li>
  <li>Anything new, useful, and surprising</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
These are all professional or corporate terms which look good on paper but hard to understand for the heart and mind.</p>

<h3>Just Innovation!</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
It is something that one does when they don't want to follow the already available methods.
Finding a solution to a problem from the usual solution being used for years by the crowd.
It does not come by practice, nor by hard work. It comes with pure knowledge and the intention to feel and do things the other way.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
It does not always mean being successful, sometimes many people find innovative ways of failure that one could not imagine.
Being able to do something in an algorithmic way is never innovation. The person who developed that algorithm was Innovative not the one currently using it.
We spend most of our time in using the methods or ways given by innovative people. We hardly spend any time or thought in creating our own innovative ideas to do something.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Innovation is attractive, we all like it. Just adding a new flavor to Coffee makes it Innovative. It's not something too hard to do but too hard to think!.
Most innovations are coincidence or accidents happened to people and in those times they discovered a new way.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Most scientists are busy in doing research but not Innovation. We are busy in finding something that is already available but doesn't want to give a thought of 
creating something way too different than already available. <br><br>

The best example is transportation. Engineers and Scientists spend years in achieving high speeds. From inventing the wheel to Space Rockets the era changed and the innovations came in the picture.
But going the same way isn't the way to Innovate anymore. We want to achieve light speed with fuel and propulsion. We never gave a thought to something new.<br><br>

The Wormhole was one of the most innovative ideas for transportation. But most of the time the Innovative things are merely believed to be fictions rather than reality.<br><br>

Another field is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. In reality, if we go deep into the foundations of it. It is using mathematical formulas in an intelligent way and trains the Model to perform something.
It isn't intelligence. Cognitive Science is a much promising field but it is mostly seen in fiction and Movies and thought to be something dangerous.
Watch 5-10 AI movies and even the AI researcher will start thinking "Am I the devil who is working on something evil?"
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Science is beautiful, it answers our questions and Mathematics backs it up with prooves. Innovations are the need and necessity of Science. 
Learning from the already available researches and Innovating something new is the pure use of Science and Knowledge.
