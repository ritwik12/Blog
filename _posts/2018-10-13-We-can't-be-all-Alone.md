title: We can't be all Alone!!
---

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The same question again and again over many centuries, How can we be all alone in this never ending vast Universe. To get an idea 
of how big this universe is? Let's see few things.</p>

<h3>XDF</h3>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/XDF.jpg)

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The <b>Hubble Space Telescope</b> has captured the farthest-ever view into the universe, a photo that reveals thousands of galaxies 
billions of light-years away.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The picture, called <b>eXtreme Deep Field</b>, or XDF, combines 10 years of Hubble telescope views of one patch of sky. Only the 
accumulated light gathered over so many observation sessions can reveal such distant objects, some of which are one ten-billionth 
the brightness that the human eye can see.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The photo is a sequel to the original "Hubble Ultra Deep Field," a picture the Hubble Space Telescope took in 2003 and 2004 that 
collected light over many hours to reveal thousands of distant galaxies in what was the deepest view of the universe so far. 
The XDF goes even farther, peering back 13.2 billion years into the universe's past. The universe is thought to be about 13.7 
billion years old.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
"The XDF is the deepest image of the sky ever obtained and reveals the faintest and most distant galaxies ever seen," Garth 
Illingworth of the University of California at Santa Cruz, principal investigator of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field 2009 program, 
said in a statement. "XDF allows us to explore further back in time than ever before."</p>

<h3>Cosmic Eye</h3>

Another view of how big the universe is, 1 billion light years is the distance shown here. So, even light needs 1 billion years 
to reach earth from there which means we are looking 1 billion years in the past. Lots of things visible in the night sky could 
not be even there in reality and so many things which are there may not be visible as they are so far away that light from those
objects takes years to travel to earth. If a star dies or born in our universe then we will not be able to know notice that for 
almost thousands of years.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1">Voyager 1</a> is the first manmade object to travel beyond the solar system 
and reach Interstellar space. It is travelling at a speed of <b>17 km per second</b>. The speed of light is <b>299792 Kms per 
second<b> and the nearest star to us is <b>Proxima Centauri</b> which is about 4.22 light years away from us. Proxima Centauri 
has been suggested as a logical first destination for interstellar travel, although as a flare star it would not be particularly
hospitable. The current standard spaceship, the Space Shuttle, travels in orbit at 7.8 km per second. At that speed, it would 
take 160,000 years to reach Proxima. The fastest man-made spacecraft, the Helios II deep space probe, has set a speed record of 
70.2 km per second. Even at that speed, the journey to Proxima Centauri would take 18,000 years. The proposed VASIMR propulsion 
system, possibly able to achieve speeds up to 300 km per second, would shorten the journey to a "mere" 4,200 years â€”still firmly
beyond the current lifespan of both man and machine.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
That was just one star we have talked about and even travelling to that isn't possible right now. There are about 10 billion 
galaxies in the observable universe! The number of stars in a galaxy varies, but assuming an average of 100 billion stars per 
galaxy means that there are about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (that's 1 billion trillion) stars in the observable universe!. 
Wait, here I just said <b>observable universe!</b>. All the stars, planets and galaxies that can be seen today make up just 4 
percent of the universe. The other 96 percent is made of stuff astronomers can't see, detect or even comprehend. These 
mysterious substances are called <b>dark energy</b> and <b>dark matter</b>. Astronomers infer their existence based on their 
gravitational influence on what little bits of the universe can be seen, but dark matter and energy themselves continue to 
elude all detection.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
We have already seen how vast the universe is and it is just 4 percent of the actual universe present out there. So, how could that
be possible that we are alone? It isn't satisfying to believe that we are and it isn't yet to be proved that we aren't.  The Solar 
System's planets (8 in total) and officially recognized dwarf planets are known to be orbited by 194 natural satellites, or moons. 
There is already so much in our own solar system that we can't even think about other solar systems to be explored. We are trying
our best to increase the speed of travel by creating much faster space shuttles. But we can never reach explore the world with 
just speed. The speed of light is the fastest thing in the universe and even it is not enough when it comes to Interstellar space.
The approach needs to be changed. It's just like walking faster and faster when you should be traveling by airplane. The theory 
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole">Wormholes</a> seems w=fictional right now. But if it is true then we can explore 
the universe without the limit of speed, "Decreasing distance is better than increasing speed".</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
There may be a chance that if someone from outer space or humans from earth send signals to each other then one may not be able 
to receive it for millions of years and maybe by then the entire living species of that planet becomes extinct.</p>

The question is going to be unanswered for generations and maybe the ones reading this will never be able to know the answer.
