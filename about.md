Hey, Iâ€™m Ritwik Sharma, spending my each day at LinkedIn as an Site Reliability Engineer.
I was a Software Engineering Intern at Red Hat in Performance and Scaling team.


I like to work on Open source and I am always eager for new ideas and opportunities to work on, I like to code and I try my best to improve my coding skills whenever I can. As in a world full of great programmers I am a small fraction.
